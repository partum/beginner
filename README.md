# Beginner Project Fiesta 🪇
This is a demonstration of several beginner projects from [this repo](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas). I felt that they were all too small to justify their own repo, so I have collected them all here. 
## Technologies 🌮
- React
- Vite
- HTML
- CSS
## Features 🌵
1. Binary to Decimal converter [brief](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Bin2Dec-App.md)
2. Countdown timer [brief](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Countdown-Timer-App.md)
## The Process 🌶️
-
## What I Learned 🪅
For the first project I had to review how to convert between decimal and binary and how to do regex.
## What Could Be Improved 💃
I think the first project it good but the next logical step would be to convert from decimal to binary.
## Demonstration 🌯
Insert a video of the project in action or at least some screen shots 𐂃
